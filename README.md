# Java Toolbox

Welcome to the **Java Toolbox**!

This repository serves as a collection of practical "How-to" guides and ready-to-use code examples for tackling common tasks and exploring useful patterns in Java development. Whether you're looking for a quick solution or want to understand a specific concept, the Java Toolbox aims to provide clear and helpful resources.

### ðŸ¤” How to Do It in Java?

We're building this toolbox by addressing frequent questions Java developers face. Each guide focuses on a specific task, breaking it down with explanations and accompanying code.

Currently, the toolbox includes an answer to:

* **How to send email from Java Applications or Programs?**
    * Navigate to the dedicated guide: [**Guide: Sending Emails from Java**](send-email/how-to-send-email.md)
    * This guide covers using the standard Jakarta Mail API to send simple text emails, HTML emails, and emails with attachments.

### ðŸŒ± What's Next?

This is just the beginning! We plan to continuously add more guides covering a wide range of Java topics and challenges.

Stay tuned for more practical examples, or feel free to [suggest a topic](link_to_issues - consider adding this) or even [contribute your own guide](link_to_contributing - consider adding this)!

### ðŸš€ How to Use

Simply navigate to the guide you're interested in using the links above. Each guide is located in its own directory (like `send-email/`) and contains a detailed `README.md` explaining the process, along with the relevant Java code examples you can explore and use.
